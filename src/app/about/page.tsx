            <p className='font-bold font-mono text-center text-lime-900  shadow-lg flex-wrap m-32'>Hello, my name is Abdul Mannan and I am a computer science student.

                I love learning how computers work, how they interact with the human world, and what makes them tick. I am excited to learn more about this field and continue contributing to the world around me through technology.

                I’ve always been passionate about learning new things, whether reading a book or watching a movie—I just can’t get enough of it! My most extensive interests include programming, mathematics, and economics—no matter what I’m doing at school or working on in my free time, you’ll always find me surrounded by books and computers.</p>
